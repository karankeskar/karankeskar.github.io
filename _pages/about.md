I'm a Software Engineer based in Sydney, Australia, passionate about building scalable applications and solving complex problems. I specialize in full-stack development, with expertise spanning modern web technologies, cloud platforms, and algorithmic problem-solving.

Currently, I'm on a 24-week learning journey where I build projects and share my progress weekly, while deepening my knowledge in data structures, algorithms, and system design. When I'm not coding, I'm exploring new technologies, contributing to the developer community, and staying current with industry trends.
I'm always interested in connecting with fellow developers and discussing interesting technical challenges. Feel free to reach out!
